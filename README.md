# Grade Calculator
## Background 
The Grade Calculator app is a handy tool for students to keep track of their grades and calculate their overall course grade. The app features a table that lists all of the assignments in a course, along with the grade and weight of each assignment. There is also a form that lets users add new assignments to the table. The app is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
To calculate the overall grade, the app uses the following formula </br> 
### *overall grade = (sum of (grade * weight)) / sum of weights* </br> 
This formula takes into account the weight of each assignment, so assignments with higher weights will have a greater impact on the overall grade. With the Grade Calculator app, students can easily keep track of their grades and see how they are progressing in their courses.
