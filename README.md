# Grade Calculator
## Background 
The Grade Calculator app is a handy tool for students to keep track of their grades and calculate their overall course grade. The app features a table that lists all of the assignments in a course, along with the grade and weight of each assignment. There is also a form that lets users add new assignments to the table. The app is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
To calculate the overall grade, the app uses the following formula </br> 
### *overall grade = (sum of (grade * weight)) / sum of weights* </br> 
This formula takes into account the weight of each assignment, so assignments with higher weights will have a greater impact on the overall grade. With the Grade Calculator app, students can easily keep track of their grades and see how they are progressing in their courses.

By dividing the user interface into reusable components, React makes it easier to build and maintain the grade calculator app.
